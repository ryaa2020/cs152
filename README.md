## Project Description

My project will focus on training neural networks (NNs) to predict the popularity of instagram posts. I want to determine which aspects of a post, its aestehtic value, the image content, and social metadata impact the popularity (otherwise known as viralness) of a post. In the end, my project will be able to determine, given a vareity of pictures, which one will become viral and why. I hope to do feature analysis on which aspects of the picture influence its popularity. 
The longer term goal is to predict the popularity of longer videos like tiktoks and instagram reels to determine which videos may become viral. Additionally, I want to analyze how trends influence the popularity of posts or if posts influence what is trending. 

## Project Goals

1. Successfully scrape instagram posts to create a dataset for training a Neural Network.
2. To accruately categorize the popularity of existing instagram posts. 
3. Determine what features influence the popularity of instagram posts. 
4. Predict the viralness of photos taken with varying features.
