## Project Description

The goal of our project is to train a neural network to apply the style of one image to another image. The network will be trained on a large dataset of style images and content images, and it will learn to transfer the style of the style image to the content image. The resulting model will be capable of transforming a simple photo into a masterpiece painting, for example. To add on to this, we want to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to take the style of one image and generate new images in the same style. The model will be capable of generating new images that are similar in style to the images in the training set.

## Project Goals

1. Collect a large dataset of style images and content images
2. Train a neural network to transfer the style of a style image to a content image
3. Train a GAN on the collected dataset 
4. Evaluate the quality of the generated images using standard metrics
5. Compare the results to other state-of-the-art models for style transfer
6. Explore the potential of using the model for applications such as creating custom art pieces or enhancing the visual appeal of existing photos or videos

## Project Scope
The goal of this project is to train a neural network to create and transfer styles of images

## Introduction Outline
#### Five to Ten Sentence Outline:
Paragraph 1. Introductory paragraph: 
- The task of generating new images in the style of a specific artist or artwork is challenging as it requires an understanding of the unique characteristics and techniques used by the artist. Our solution to this challenge is to train a neural network on a large dataset of images in the desired style.

Paragraph 2. Background paragraph: 
- Prior work in this field has focused on using transfer learning from pre-trained models, however, these models are not always able to capture the fine-grained details of a specific style. Our approach will involve training a neural network from scratch to overcome this limitation.

Paragraph 3. Transition paragraph: 
- By training a neural network from scratch, we can ensure that it has a deeper understanding of the desired style and is able to generate more accurate results.

Paragraph 4. Details paragraph: 
- The project will involve collecting a large dataset of images in the desired style, preprocessing the data, and training a neural network using a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. We will evaluate the quality of the generated images using standard metrics such as inception score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID).

Paragraph 5. Assessment paragraph: 
- Our expected results are high-quality generated images in the style of the desired artist or artwork. These results support the conclusion that neural networks can be trained to generate new images in a specific style and have potential applications in areas such as digital art and advertising. The structure of the paper will include an introduction, background, methodology, results, and conclusion sections.

#### Ethical Sweep:
- Should we even be doing this? This project is focused on creating new artwork using artificial intelligence which may raise discussions on AI having a negative impact towards artists. 
- What might be the accuracy of a simple non-ML alternative? A simple non-ML alternative, such as manual painting or drawing, may not be able to generate as many high-quality images in a specific style as a neural network.
- What processes will we use to handle appeals/mistakes? If any mistakes are made during the project, they will be addressed and corrected as needed.
- How diverse is our team? Our team consists of three individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
