## Project Description

My project will focus on training neural networks (NNs) to predict the popularity of instagram posts. I want to determine which aspects of a post, its aestehtic value, the image content, and social metadata impact the popularity (otherwise known as viralness) of a post. 

The longer term goal is to predict the popularity of longer videos like tiktoks and instagram reels to determine which videos may become viral.

## Project Goals

1. Create a dataset for training a NN for navigation.
2. Explore methods for adding "noise" to the dataset.
3. Train a NN that is able to navigate any procedurally generated maze.
