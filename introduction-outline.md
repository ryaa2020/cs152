## Project Scope: The goal of this project is to train a neural network to create and transfer styles of images

**Team members:** Maika Nishiguchi, Seho Kwak, and Rachel Yang

#### Five to Ten Sentence Outline:
Paragraph 1. Introductory paragraph: 
- The task of generating new images in the style of a specific artist or artwork is challenging as it requires an understanding of the unique characteristics and techniques used by the artist. Our solution to this challenge is to train a neural network on a large dataset of images in the desired style.

Paragraph 2. Background paragraph: 
- Prior work in this field has focused on using transfer learning from pre-trained models, however, these models are not always able to capture the fine-grained details of a specific style. Our approach will involve training a neural network from scratch to overcome this limitation.

Paragraph 3. Transition paragraph: 
- By training a neural network from scratch, we can ensure that it has a deeper understanding of the desired style and is able to generate more accurate results.

Paragraph 4. Details paragraph: 
- The project will involve collecting a large dataset of images in the desired style, preprocessing the data, and training a neural network using a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. We will evaluate the quality of the generated images using standard metrics such as inception score and Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID).

Paragraph 5. Assessment paragraph: 
- Our expected results are high-quality generated images in the style of the desired artist or artwork. These results support the conclusion that neural networks can be trained to generate new images in a specific style and have potential applications in areas such as digital art and advertising. The structure of the paper will include an introduction, background, methodology, results, and conclusion sections.

#### Ethical Sweep:
- Should we even be doing this? This project is focused on creating new artwork using artificial intelligence which may raise discussions on AI having a negative impact towards artists. 
- What might be the accuracy of a simple non-ML alternative? A simple non-ML alternative, such as manual painting or drawing, may not be able to generate as many high-quality images in a specific style as a neural network.
- What processes will we use to handle appeals/mistakes? If any mistakes are made during the project, they will be addressed and corrected as needed.
- How diverse is our team? Our team consists of three individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
