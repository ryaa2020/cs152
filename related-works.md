4. "A Method for Style Transfer from Artistic Images Based on Depth Extraction Generative Adversarial Network" by Xinying Han, Yang Wu, and Rui Wan
  - The researchers propose a multi-feature extractor to extract color features, texture features, depth features, and shape masks from style images with U-net, multi-factor extractor, fast Fourier transform, and MiDas depth estimation network. At the same time, a self-encoder structure is used as the content extraction network core to generate a network that shares style parameters with the feature extraction network and finally realizes the generation of artwork images in three-dimensional artistic styles. The experimental analysis shows that compared with other advanced methods, DE-GAN-generated images have higher subjective image quality, and the generated style pictures are more consistent with the aesthetic characteristics of real works of art. The quantitative data analysis shows that images generated using the DE-GAN method have better performance in terms of structural features, image distortion, image clarity, and texture details. 
    
5. "Neural Style Transfer: A Paradigm Shift for Image-based Artistic Rendering?" by Amir Semmo, Tobias Isenberg, and Jürgen Döllner
  - The authors discuss the potential benefits of neural style transfer, including the ability to create high-quality, artistically styled images quickly and easily, as well as the potential for automating certain aspects of the artistic process. They also explore the limitations and challenges of neural style transfer, such as the difficulty of controlling the output and the potential for over-reliance on pre-existing styles. The paper concludes by proposing future research directions, including the need for a better understanding of the relationship between style and content in neural style transfer, and the development of new techniques for style transfer that address some of its current limitations.
